#Project Title; Coding Quiz for Dummies

Description of the App; 
As an introduction to world of coding we were tasked with the construction of a Coding quiz to prepare us for any job interviews in the future. The quiz gives you 90 seconds to complete 4 questions which is a huge amount of time. Each incorrect answer decreases the timer by 4 seconds as a punishment for not knowing the answer. If you complete the quiz in time then there is a section that allows the user to save their score for a later time in the local storage. There was moment where I thought I could construct my own questions so I created a quiz around the Crusades. That is now in the local branch for anyone to check out.
